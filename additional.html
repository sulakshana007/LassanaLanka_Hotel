        <h1>Sri Lanka</h1>
        <p>
          Sri Lanka's documented history goes back 3,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric human
           settlements that dates to at least 125,000 years ago. It has a rich cultural heritage.
            The earliest known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka, known collectively as the Pāli canon,
             date to the fourth Buddhist council, which took place in 29 BCE. Sri Lanka's geographic
             location and deep harbours have made it of great strategic importance, from the earliest days of
              the ancient Silk Road trade route to today's so-called maritime Silk Road. Because its location
               made it a major trading hub, it was already known to both Far Easterners and Europeans as long
                ago as the Anuradhapura period. The country's trade in luxury goods and spices attracted traders
                of many nations, which helped to create Sri Lanka's diverse population. During a period of great
                 political crisis in the Sinhalese kingdom of Kotte, the Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka (largely by accident)
                  and then sought to control the island's maritime regions and its lucrative external trade. Part of Sri Lanka
                   became a Portuguese possession. After the Sinhalese-Portuguese war, the Dutch and the Kingdom of Kandy took
                   control of those areas. The Dutch possessions were then taken by the British, who later extended their control
                   over the whole island, colonising it from 1815 to 1948. A national movement for political independence arose in
                    the early 20th century, and in 1948, Ceylon became a dominion. The dominion was succeeded by the republic named
                     Sri Lanka in 1972. Sri Lanka's more recent history was marred by a 26-year civil war, which began in 1983 and
                      ended decisively in 2009, when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

          Today, Sri Lanka is a multinational state, home to diverse cultures, languages, and ethnicities. The Sinhalese are the
          majority of the nation's population. The Tamils, who are a large minority group, have also played an influential role in
          the island's history. Other long established groups include the Moors, the Burghers, the Malays, the Chinese, and the indigenous Vedda.

          The island has had a long history of engagement with modern international groups: it is a founding member of the SAARC and a
           member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G77, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Sri Lanka is the highest-ranked
           South Asian nation on the Human Development Index and has the second-highest per capita income in South Asia.

	  <h1>History of Sri Lanka</h1>

        <p>
          According to the Mahāvamsa, a Pāḷi chronicle written in the 5th century CE, the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka are
           said to be the Yakshas and Nagas. Ancient cemeteries that were used before 600 BCE and other signs of advanced civilisation
           have also been discovered in Sri Lanka. Sinhalese history traditionally starts in 543 BCE with the arrival of Prince Vijaya,
            a semi-legendary prince who sailed with 700 followers to Sri Lanka, after being expelled from Vanga Kingdom (present-day Bengal).
             He established the Kingdom of Tambapanni, near modern-day Mannar. Vijaya (Singha) is the first of the approximately 189 monarchs of
             Sri Lanka described in chronicles such as the Dipavamsa, Mahāvaṃsa, Cūḷavaṃsa, and Rājāvaliya.

          Once Prakrit speakers had attained dominance on the island, the Mahavamsa further recounts the later migration of royal brides
          and service castes from the Tamil Pandya Kingdom to the Anuradhapura Kingdom in the early historic period.
          The Soulbury constitution ushered in dominion status, with independence proclaimed on 4 February 1948.
           D. S. Senanayake became the first Prime Minister of Ceylon. Prominent Tamil leaders including Ponnambalam
           and Arunachalam Mahadeva joined his cabinet. The British Royal Navy remained stationed at Trincomalee
           until 1956. A countrywide popular demonstration against withdrawal of the rice rations resulted in the resignation of
            prime minister Dudley Senanayake.

S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was elected prime minister in 1956. His three-year rule had a profound impact through his self-proclaimed
 role of "defender of the besieged Sinhalese culture". He introduced the controversial Sinhala Only Act, recognising Sinhala as
  the only official language of the government. Although partially reversed in 1958, the bill posed a grave concern for the Tamil community,
   which perceived in it a threat to their language and culture.

The Federal Party (FP) launched a movement of non-violent resistance (satyagraha) against the bill, which prompted Bandaranaike to reach an
agreement (Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact) with S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, leader of the FP, to resolve the looming ethnic conflict. The
pact proved ineffective in the face of ongoing protests by opposition and the Buddhist clergy. The bill, together with various government
colonisation schemes, contributed much towards the political rancour between Sinhalese and Tamil political leaders. Bandaranaike was
assassinated by an extremist Buddhist monk in 1959.

	  <h1>Geography</h1>


        <p>
          Sri Lanka is a pearl-shaped Island nation in South Asia, lying on the Indian Plate, a major tectonic plate that was formerly part
           of the Indo-Australian Plate. It is in the Indian Ocean southwest of the Bay of Bengal, between latitudes 5° and 10° N, and
           longitudes 79° and 82° E. Sri Lanka is separated from the mainland portion of the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and
           Palk Strait. According to Hindu mythology, a land bridge existed between the Indian mainland and Sri Lanka. It now amounts to only a
           chain of limestone shoals remaining above sea level. Legends claim that it was passable on foot up to 1480 CE, until cyclones deepened
           the channel. Portions are still as shallow as 1 metre (3 ft), hindering navigation. The island consists mostly of flat to rolling
            coastal plains, with mountains rising only in the south-central part. The highest point is Pidurutalagala, reaching 2,524 metres
             (8,281 ft) above sea level.
          A view of Sripada from Maskeliya

          Sri Lanka has 103 rivers. The longest of these is the Mahaweli River, extending 335 kilometres (208 mi). These waterways give rise to 51
           natural waterfalls of 10 metres (33 ft) or more. The highest is Bambarakanda Falls, with a height of 263 metres (863 ft). Sri Lanka's coastline is
           1,585 km (985 mi) long. Sri Lanka claims an exclusive economic zone extending 200 nautical miles, which is approximately 6.7 times Sri Lanka's
           land area. The coastline and adjacent waters support highly productive marine ecosystems such as fringing coral reefs and shallow beds of coastal and
            estuarine seagrasses.

          Sri Lanka has 45 estuaries and 40 lagoons. Sri Lanka's mangrove ecosystem spans over 7,000 hectares and played
          a vital role in buffering the force of the waves in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.The island is rich in minerals such as ilmenite,
           feldspar, graphite, silica, kaolin, mica and thorium. Existence of petroleum and gas in the Gulf of Mannar has also been
            confirmed, and the extraction of recoverable quantities is underway

	  <h1>Climate</h1>

        <p>


          The climate is tropical and warm, because of moderating effects of ocean winds. Mean temperatures range from 17 °C (62.6 °F) in the central highlands,
           where frost may occur for several days in the winter, to a maximum of 33 °C (91.4 °F) in low-altitude areas. Average yearly temperatures range from 28 °C
           (82.4 °F) to nearly 31 °C (87.8 °F). Day and night temperatures may vary by 14 °C (57.2 °F) to 18 °C (64.4 °F).

          The rainfall pattern is influenced by monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. The "wet zone" and some of the windward slopes of the
           central highlands receive up to 2,500 millimetres (98.4 in) of rain each year, but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain.
            Most of the east, southeast, and northern parts of Sri Lanka comprise the "dry zone", which receives between 1,200 and 1,900 mm  of rain annually.

          The arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least rain at 800 to 1,200 mm (31 to 47 in) per year. Periodic squalls occur and sometimes tropical
          cyclones bring overcast skies and rains to the southwest, northeast, and eastern parts of the island. Humidity is typically higher in the southwest and
           mountainous areas and depends on the seasonal patterns of rainfall. An increase in average rainfall coupled with heavier rainfall events has resulted
            in recurrent flooding and related damages to infrastructure, utility supply and the urban economy.

	  <h1>Government and politics</h1>

        <p>
          The current political culture in Sri Lanka is a contest between two rival coalitions led by the centre-left and progressive United
          People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), an offspring of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and the comparatively right-wing and pro-capitalist
           United National Party (UNP). Sri Lanka is essentially a multi-party democracy with many smaller Buddhist, socialist and Tamil nationalist
           political parties. As of July 2011, the number of registered political parties in the country is 67. Of these, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP),
            established in 1935, is the oldest.

          The UNP, established by D. S. Senanayake in 1946, was until recently the largest single political party. It is the only political
           group which had representation in all parliaments since independence. SLFP was founded by S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike in July 1951. SLFP registered its
            first victory in 1956, defeating the ruling UNP in 1956 Parliamentary election.Following the parliamentary election in July 1960,
             Sirimavo Bandaranaike became the prime minister and the world's first elected female head of government.

	  <h1>Economy</h1>

        <p>
          According to the International Monetary Fund, Sri Lanka's GDP in terms of purchasing power parity is the second highest in the South Asian region in
           terms of per capita income. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Sri Lanka became a plantation economy famous for its production and export of cinnamon,
           rubber, and Ceylon tea, which remains a trademark national export. The development of modern ports under British rule raised the strategic importance
            of the island as a centre of trade.From 1948 to 1977, socialism strongly influenced the government's economic policies. Colonial plantations were
             dismantled, industries were nationalised, and a welfare state established. In 1977, the free market economy was introduced to the country, incorporating
              privatisation, deregulation, and the promotion of private enterprise.
The Colombo World Trade Center in Colombo. Presidential Secretariat, Bank of Ceylon and Galadhari Hotel are also visible in the image.

While the production and export of tea, rubber, coffee, sugar, and other commodities remain important, industrialisation has increased the importance of food processing, textiles, telecommunications, and finance. The country's main economic sectors are tourism, tea export, clothing, rice production, and other agricultural products. In addition to these economic sectors, overseas employment, especially in the Middle East, contributes substantially in foreign exchange.[240]

As of 2010, the service sector makes up 60% of GDP, the industrial sector 28%, and the agriculture sector 12%. The private sector accounts
 for 85% of the economy. China, India and the United States are Sri Lanka's largest trading partners. Economic disparities exist between the provinces with
 the Western Province contributing 45.1% of the GDP and the Southern Province and the Central Province contributing 10.7% and 10%, respectively. With the
  end of the war, the Northern Province reported a record 22.9% GDP growth in 2010.
